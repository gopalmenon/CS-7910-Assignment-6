\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{(20 points)} In this exercise, we consider the \emph{Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)}.
Let G be a \textbf{complete directed graph}. Each directed edge $(v_i,v_j)$ has a weight $w(v_i,v_j)$. It is possible that $w(v_i,v_j) \neq w(v_j,v_i)$, i.e., the edge weights can be asymmetric.
The optimization version of the TSP problem is to find a cycle $C$ in $G$ containing each vertex of $G$ exactly once such that the total weight of the edges of $C$ is minimized.
The decision problem of TSP is as follows. Given a value $W$, decide whether $G$ has a cycle $C$ that contains each vertex of $G$ exactly once such that the total weight of the edges of $C$ is at most $W$.
Prove that the decision problem of TSP is NP-Complete (Hint: by a reduction from the Hamiltonian Cycle problem).\\

The Hamiltonian Cycle problem is known to be NP-Complete.

\item This is a \enquote{warm-up} exercise on designing approximation algorithms.
A variation of the \emph{knapsack problem} is defined as follows (actually it is the subset-sum problem): Given as input a knapsack of size $K$ and $n$ items whose sizes are $k_1, k_2, \ldots , k_n$, where $K$ and $k_1, k_2, \ldots , k_n$ are all positive real numbers, find a full \enquote{packing} of the knapsack (i.e., choose a subset of the $n$ items such that the total sum of the sizes of the items in the chosen subset is \emph{exactly} equal to $K$).
We have proven that this problem is NP-complete, which implies that it is very likely that efficient algorithms (i.e., polynomial-time algorithms) for this problem do not exist. Thus, people tend to look for good \textbf{approximation algorithms} for solving this problem. In this exercise, we relax the constraint of the knapsack problem as follows. We still seek a packing of the knapsack, but we need not look for a \enquote{full} packing of the knapsack; instead, we look for a packing of the knapsack (i.e., a subset of the $n$ input items) such that the total sum of the sizes of the items in the chosen subset is at least $\frac{K}{2}$ (but no more than $K$). This is called a \emph{factor of} 2 \emph{approximation solution} for the knapsack problem. To simplify the problem, we assume that a factor of 2 approximation solution for the input always exists, i.e, there always exists a subset of items whose total size is at least $\frac{K}{2}$ and at most $K$.
\begin{enumerate}\item \textbf{(20 points)} Design a \emph{polynomial-time} algorithm for computing a factor of 2 approximation solution, and analyze the running time of your algorithm (using the big-$O$ notation).\item \textbf{(5 points)} Improve your algorithm to $O(n)$ time. If your algorithm for part (a) already runs in $O(n)$ time, then you will get the five points automatically.
\end{enumerate}\textbf{Note:} You are required to clearly describe the main idea of your algorithm. Although the pseudo-code is not required, you may also give the pseudo-code if you feel it is helpful for you to explain your algorithm. You also need to briefly explain why your algorithm works, i.e., why your algorithm can produce a factor of 2 approximation solution. Finally, please analyze the running time of your algorithm.

\end{enumerate}
